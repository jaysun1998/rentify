## User Experience & UI Guidelines

### Design Principles

- **Clean, Intuitive Design Patterns**
    - Utilize a **modular component library** (React + React Native) with a consistent atomic design system (atoms, molecules, organisms).
    - Prioritize whitespace, clear hierarchy, and minimal visual noise.
    - Use consistent typography scales (e.g., **Heading 1 – 24 px**, **Body – 16 px**, **Caption – 12 px**) and spacing units (multiples of 4 px).
- **Consistent Navigation**
    - **Web (React)**: Top navigation bar with primary sections (Dashboard, Properties, Tenants, Maintenance, Finance, Reports, Settings).
    - **Mobile (React Native)**: Bottom tab bar (Dashboard, Properties, Maintenance, Messages, Profile).
    - Each section follows a consistent layout: list/detail pattern, breadcrumbs on web, and clear back navigation on mobile.
- **Design Tokens & Theming**
    - Define colors, typography, spacing, and elevation tokens in a shared theme file to ensure consistency across web and mobile.
    - Support light/dark modes with automatic system detection; customize contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 AA.

### Onboarding Flow (Web & Mobile)

1. **Company / User Details**
    - **Step 1**: Company name, address, tax ID, VAT number (web form).
    - **Step 2**: User profile (name, email, role)—with avatar upload.
2. **Bank Integration**
    - **Step 3**: SEPA mandate form or PSD2 consent flow (mobile seamlessly redirects to authentication).
    - **Step 4**: Confirmation screen with mandate details and digital signature.
3. **Property Import / Setup**
    - **Step 5**: Upload CSV template or manual entry in guided forms (web).
    - **Step 6**: Configure default lease terms (lease length, rent escalation).
4. **Invite Team Members**
    - **Step 7**: Enter emails, assign roles; send invite links.
5. **First Listing Publication (Optional)**
    - **Step 8**: Select one property to publish to listing portals; preview listings.
6. **Mobile‐Specific Tips**
    - **In-App Tour**: Brief walkthrough of key screens (dashboard, maintenance, payments).
    - **Push Notification Permissions**: Prompt user to enable notifications for rent due, maintenance assignments.

### Component & Screen Guidelines

- **Dashboard Widgets**
    - **Web**: Draggable, resizable cards for metrics (occupancy rate, arrears, upcoming maintenance).
    - **Mobile**: Scrollable list of cards; key metrics appear at top (“At a Glance”).
- **Property List / Detail**
    - **Web**: Table view with filters (city, status, vacancy). Clicking a row opens a detail drawer.
    - **Mobile**: Card‐based list; tap to open a full‐screen detail view with swipe gestures to navigate units.
- **Maintenance Requests**
    - **Web**: Kanban‐style board with columns (Open, In Progress, Completed). Drag & drop to transition.
    - **Mobile**: Simplified list view showing status icons; swipe left/right to change status; “+” FAB for new request.
- **Forms & Data Entry**
    - Use inline validation: immediate feedback on required fields or incorrect formats (e.g., IBAN).
    - Break long forms into multi‐step wizards with progress indicators.
    - Mobile forms use larger touch targets (minimum 44 px) and optimized for single‐hand use.
- **Notifications & Alerts**
    - **Web**: Toast snackbars for non-blocking notifications; modal dialogs for critical confirmations (e.g., deleting a lease).
    - **Mobile**: Local push notifications for rent due reminders, assigned maintenance, and lease expirations; in-app banners for events.

    - **Profile & Settings**: Manage user profile, notification preferences, language selection, and security (MFA settings).
3. **Offline Support & Sync**
    - For Maintenance Service: queue new or updated work orders offline; synchronize automatically when connectivity is restored.
    - Local caching for critical lookups (tenant list, property list) via Realm or SQLite.
    - Use Redux or Context API for state management; persist key state slices to AsyncStorage.
4. **Push Notifications**
    - Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for cross‐platform notifications.
    - Notify users of rent due, maintenance assignments, lease renewals, and system alerts.
5. **App Performance & Best Practices**
    - Optimize bundle size using Hermes engine and code splitting.
    - Lazy load screens and images; prefetch data for anticipated user flows.
    - Use FlatList/SectionList with proper keyExtractor for large lists.
    - Monitor performance with React Native Performance Monitor and Sentry for error tracking.

    - **Finance Service**: Basic ledger entries, VAT handling, deposit management.
    - **Payment Service**: SEPA direct debit integration (GoCardless sandbox).
    - Web: Lease creation UI, accounting dashboard for finance managers.
    - Mobile: Lease view and sign functionality in React Native; display payment status.
4. **Sprint 4 (Weeks 13–16): Maintenance & Listing Integrations**
    - **Maintenance Service**: Work order creation, status tracking, attachments handling.
    - **Listing Service**: Integrate with UK (Rightmove) and Germany (ImmobilienScout24) APIs.
    - Web: Kanban board and listing management UI.
    - Mobile: Submit maintenance requests via React Native, with camera integration.
5. **Sprint 5 (Weeks 17–20): Portals, Reporting & Mobile Parity**
    - **Tenant & Owner Portal**: Build React web portals for tenants and owners with simplified design patterns.
    - **Reporting Service**: Implement rent roll, P&L, and VAT return reports.
    - React Native app parity: Dashboards (At-a-Glance), property/maintenance sections, payment pages.
    - Localization QA for de-DE, fr-FR, es-ES.
6. **Sprint 6 (Weeks 21–24): Production Readiness & Beta Launch**
    - Performance/load testing; microservices resilience testing (circuit breakers, retries).
    - Finalize GDPR/eIDAS compliance checks; run penetration tests.
    - Allocate short iteration to UI polish: ensure consistent, intuitive design patterns across screens.
    - Onboard pilot customers in UK and Germany; gather feedback and iterate.

## Risks & Mitigations

1. **Complexity of Microservices Coordination**
    - *Risk*: Multiple services increase operational overhead (orchestration, monitoring).
    - *Mitigation*: Adopt a service mesh (e.g., AWS App Mesh) early; centralize observability (Prometheus/Grafana, X-Ray). Enforce consistent logging and tracing standards.
2. **React Native Feature Parity Delays**
    - *Risk*: Mobile app lags behind web in feature rollout, leading to inconsistent user experience.
    - *Mitigation*: Maintain a shared component library and theme package; parallel web/mobile feature sprints; allocate dedicated mobile engineering resources.
3. **Regulatory Gaps Across EU Countries**
    - *Risk*: Divergent tenancy laws and VAT rules hamper product consistency.
    - *Mitigation*: Build configurable rule engines in microservices; engage local legal consultants; create country‐specific configuration files.
4. **Design Complexity Leading to Inconsistent UI**
    - *Risk*: Multiple platforms and features lead to design drift.
    - *Mitigation*: Centralize design tokens, component library, and cross‐platform style guides; conduct biweekly design reviews with web and mobile designers.
5. **Integration Delays with Third‐Party APIs**
    - *Risk*: Slow approvals or API changes from listing portals or banks.
    - *Mitigation*: Start partnership agreements early; develop sandbox mocks; provide fallback manual workflows in the portal for listing uploads.

## Future Considerations

- **AI‐Driven Rent Optimization**: Leverage machine learning to analyze market data and recommend rent adjustments.
- **Green/Energy Reporting**: Automate energy usage reporting and recommend sustainable upgrades (align with EU’s Green Deal objectives).
- **Blockchain for Security Deposits**: Use smart contracts on Hyperledger Fabric for transparent deposit holding and release.
- **Open API Marketplace**: Allow third‐party developers to extend functionality (e.g., AI bots for tenant screening, chatbots).
- **Multi‐Tenant SaaS Architecture**: Expand support for multi‐entity portfolios (e.g., REITs, institutional investors) with custom branding and role hierarchies.
