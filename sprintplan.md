Building the full AppFolio data model in **5 hours** is an ambitious task. It would require efficient planning, focused execution, and teamwork. Since this model involves building a data structure and possibly UI/UX interfaces, I'll focus on **back-end implementation** of the data model and **basic API setup**. I’ll break the sprint plan into **5 one-hour segments** to ensure efficient use of time, assuming you already have a working environment and tools like a database (SQL or NoSQL), frameworks (e.g., Django, Node.js, Flask), and API tools (Postman, Swagger).

### **Agile Sprint Plan for Building AppFolio Data Model in 5 Hours**

---

### **Sprint Goal**:

Build and deploy the **core data model** and **basic API** for property management in Europe, focusing on tenants, leases, payments, properties, and compliance.

---

### **Sprint Breakdown by Hour**

#### **Hour 1: Sprint Planning & Set Up Database Schema**

* **Objective**: Set up database environment and create the core tables for the data model.

##### **Tasks**:

1. **Project Initialization**:

   * Create a new repository or project folder.
   * Initialize necessary frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, Express).
   * Set up the database connection (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.).

2. **Define Database Schema**:

   * Set up the **`Property`**, **`Tenant`**, **`Lease`**, and **`Country`** tables in the database.

     * This includes defining relationships, constraints, and indexing important fields like `tenant_id`, `property_id`, `lease_id`, and `country_id`.

3. **Initial Testing**:

   * Ensure that your models are properly connected to the database and that migrations run successfully.
   * Create an initial data entry for testing (e.g., insert dummy data for properties and tenants).

##### **Outcome**:

* Working database environment with basic tables (`Property`, `Tenant`, `Lease`, `Country`).
* Initial migrations and dummy data inserted.

---

#### **Hour 2: Implement Basic CRUD APIs for Property & Tenant Entities**

* **Objective**: Build and test basic APIs for `Property` and `Tenant` CRUD operations.

##### **Tasks**:

1. **Property CRUD API**:

   * Create API endpoints for the `Property` entity:

     * `GET /properties` – List all properties.
     * `POST /properties` – Add a new property.
     * `GET /properties/{id}` – Get a specific property by ID.
     * `PUT /properties/{id}` – Update a property by ID.
     * `DELETE /properties/{id}` – Delete a property.

2. **Tenant CRUD API**:

   * Create API endpoints for the `Tenant` entity:

     * `GET /tenants` – List all tenants.
     * `POST /tenants` – Add a new tenant.
     * `GET /tenants/{id}` – Get a specific tenant by ID.
     * `PUT /tenants/{id}` – Update a tenant by ID.
     * `DELETE /tenants/{id}` – Delete a tenant.

3. **Test CRUD APIs**:

   * Use **Postman** or **Swagger** to test the Property and Tenant APIs.
   * Ensure data validation is in place (e.g., email format, non-empty fields).

##### **Outcome**:

* Basic CRUD operations working for `Property` and `Tenant`.
* Tested with basic data to ensure API correctness.

---

#### **Hour 3: Implement Lease, Payment, and Invoice Entities**

* **Objective**: Implement APIs for `Lease`, `Payment`, and `Invoice` entities.

##### **Tasks**:

1. **Lease CRUD API**:

   * Create API endpoints for the `Lease` entity:

     * `GET /leases` – List all leases.
     * `POST /leases` – Create a new lease.
     * `GET /leases/{id}` – Get a specific lease by ID.
     * `PUT /leases/{id}` – Update a lease by ID.
     * `DELETE /leases/{id}` – Delete a lease.

2. **Payment CRUD API**:

   * Create API endpoints for the `Payment` entity:

     * `GET /payments` – List all payments.
     * `POST /payments` – Record a new payment.
     * `GET /payments/{id}` – Get a specific payment by ID.
     * `PUT /payments/{id}` – Update a payment by ID.
     * `DELETE /payments/{id}` – Delete a payment.

3. **Invoice CRUD API**:

   * Create API endpoints for the `Invoice` entity:

     * `GET /invoices` – List all invoices.
     * `POST /invoices` – Generate a new invoice.
     * `GET /invoices/{id}` – Get a specific invoice by ID.
     * `PUT /invoices/{id}` – Update an invoice by ID.
     * `DELETE /invoices/{id}` – Delete an invoice.

4. **Testing APIs**:

   * Use Postman/Swagger to test Lease, Payment, and Invoice CRUD operations.

##### **Outcome**:

* CRUD APIs working for `Lease`, `Payment`, and `Invoice` entities.
* Tested and verified via Postman/Swagger.

---

#### **Hour 4: Implement Maintenance Request & Service Provider**

* **Objective**: Implement API for Maintenance Requests and Service Providers.

##### **Tasks**:

1. **Maintenance Request CRUD API**:

   * Create API endpoints for the `Maintenance Request` entity:

     * `GET /maintenance-requests` – List all maintenance requests.
     * `POST /maintenance-requests` – Create a new maintenance request.
     * `GET /maintenance-requests/{id}` – Get a specific request by ID.
     * `PUT /maintenance-requests/{id}` – Update a maintenance request.
     * `DELETE /maintenance-requests/{id}` – Delete a request.

2. **Service Provider CRUD API**:

   * Create API endpoints for the `Service Provider` entity:

     * `GET /service-providers` – List all service providers.
     * `POST /service-providers` – Add a new service provider.
     * `GET /service-providers/{id}` – Get a specific service provider.
     * `PUT /service-providers/{id}` – Update service provider details.
     * `DELETE /service-providers/{id}` – Delete a service provider.

3. **Testing Maintenance & Service APIs**:

   * Test the maintenance request and service provider endpoints using Postman or Swagger.

##### **Outcome**:

* CRUD APIs working for `Maintenance Request` and `Service Provider`.
* Verified via testing tools.

---

#### **Hour 5: Final Testing & Deployment**

* **Objective**: Final testing, deployment, and sprint closure.

##### **Tasks**:

1. **Final API Testing**:

   * Test **all** API endpoints (Property, Tenant, Lease, Payment, Invoice, Maintenance Request, and Service Provider).
   * Ensure data flows properly between entities (e.g., Payments linked to Leases).
   * Check for edge cases (e.g., invalid data, empty fields).

2. **Error Handling & Validation**:

   * Implement basic error handling (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
   * Add input validation for critical fields (e.g., ensuring valid email formats, positive rent amount, etc.).

3. **Deployment Setup**:

   * Deploy the app to a staging server (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
   * Ensure that the database is correctly set up and migrations are in place.

4. **Sprint Retrospective**:

   * Review the progress and assess what went well and what needs improvement.

##### **Outcome**:

* All API endpoints are working correctly and tested.
* The app is deployed and accessible on a staging environment.

### **Sprint Summary:**

In **5 hours**, the sprint plan covers:

* **1 Hour**: Database schema setup and basic table creation.
* **2nd Hour**: CRUD API for Property and Tenant entities.
* **3rd Hour**: CRUD API for Lease, Payment, and Invoice entities.
* **4th Hour**: CRUD API for Maintenance Request and Service Provider entities.
* **5th Hour**: Final testing, error handling, and deployment.

This sprint should result in a **basic, functioning back-end** for AppFolio’s European data model, ready for further UI/UX enhancements and refinement. Let me know if you need any clarifications or adjustments to the plan!
